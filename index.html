                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is Bernard Sobierajski. I am a student at Oakland University studying Computer Science. My programming skills consist of 
                    Python, Java, HTML, CSS, SQL, and C. My first time trying out coding was in middle school, and since
                    then I only wanted to learn more. I pursued AP coding classes in high school and later chose Computer Science as my major in college.
                </p>

                <h3><strong>Parcel Marshall</strong></h3>
                <p>UPS Driver Assistant Application using TypeScript that allows a user to add delivery addresses into a list and sorts it based on preference of closest distance 
                    or the most optimal route. The user can use the app to navigate to their destinations or send the destinations into Google Maps and follow the navigation route. 
                    The application connected to Google Maps API to receive distance of destinations and was sorted using haversine formula to determine the most optimal route for the driver. 
                    Partial addresses were used for locations that could not be accessible on the driver’s route.</p>
                <h3><strong>BankSQL</strong></h3>
                <p>Database design & implementation project using JavaScript, Python, and HTML that involved a GUI where the user can search and insert data into a bank database including banks,
