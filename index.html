                        <p>Hello! My name is Bernard Sobierajski. I am a student at Oakland University studying Computer Science. My programming skills consist of 
                            Python, Java, HTML, CSS, SQL, and C. My first time trying out coding was in middle school, and since
                            then I only wanted to learn more. I pursued AP coding classes in high school and later chose Computer Science as my major in college.
                            Outside of school, my favorite hobbies consist of gaming, cars, listening to music, and traveling to new places!
                        </p>
